# Coding-Operations

Co-ops, or Coding Operations, is a easy-to-read, high-level, interpreted, Python based programming language. Co-Ops is inspired by Basic and a more advanced version of [Taipan](https://github.com/KipzonderKop101/Taipan). Co-Ops is made to be easy-to-read and easy-to-write, so much so that people without coding expierence can work with it, but without losing functionabilty.
