# CheetahOS

This OS is always in developement and gets many updates. It is faster and lighter weighted than other operating systems. It has FAT16 filesystem.

# Coding-Operations

Co-ops, or Coding Operations, is a easy-to-read, high-level, interpreted, Python based programming language. Co-Ops is inspired by Basic and a more advanced version of [Taipan](https://github.com/KipzonderKop101/Taipan). Co-Ops is made to be easy-to-read and easy-to-write, so much so that people without coding expierence can work with it, but without losing functionabilty. 

## Installation 

Install the files with their respective name. So `shell.py` should be named `shell.py`, etc. Then, run `shell.py` and you are ready to go. 

We are working on better ways of installing the language, but untill then, this is the way.
